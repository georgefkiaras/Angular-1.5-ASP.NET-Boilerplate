# Angular-1.5-ASP.NET-Boilerplate
Angular 1.5+ Component Architecture with WebAPI and SignalR back-end template.

## Description
This is a template project, illustrating the basic setup for:

* Angular 1.5+ component architecture.
* HTML5 component routing with IIS Rewrite.
* Getting data via WebAPI REST endpoints.
* Receiving SignalR broadcast events in the form of a server clock.
* Setting up a package.json for the client side.
* Setting up a grunt file for combining library and app files.

### Notes
* Base HREF is case SENSITIVE and needs to have start AND end trailing slashes: "/App/Boilerplate/".
* There is an internal "help" controller for webAPI help pages which still use the traditional MVC view setup. ("/Help")
* There are commented-out provisions for babel translation that are presently not being used.
